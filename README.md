The Python program was developed to integrate multiple sensors (PIR, LDR, Sound, ToF) with the NeoPixel LED strip and the Blynk Cloud platform.

The code follows a modular structure, consisting of initialization, sensor reading functions, decision logic, and LED control routines. It operates in an infinite loop, constantly reading sensor inputs and updating the LED brightness accordingly.
